# Reforesting-Entrepreneurs
This is our experiment that participated in the European Space Agency's Astro Pi 2019-2020 Competition.

## Our Idea
Every year we destroy around 15.3 billion trees worldwide. Deforestation is a tremendous problem for the human population as itis a major contributor to the loss of biodiversity and soil across the world. Global warming is further enhanced and, with the removal of transpiration as a source of rain, local climates are severely altered with extreme temperatures and a lack of precipitation. 

According to a study completed in Zurich’s ETH University [1] if we reforest a surface area the size of the USA we could mitigate the climate issue, as well as the regulation of regional climates, make a home to thousands of species and capture CO2 in the atmosphere.

Favourably, there is a growing global concern over this issue that is turning the table with different organisations, agencies, NGO’s and governments starting to invest in massive reforestation plans. A major concern these groups are facing is finding locations suitable for planting.

Our team has consequently decided to focus on this topic: search for potential locations that can be reforested using Astro Pi Izzy’s camera in the ISS with further satellite data to obtain results in almost real-time.
